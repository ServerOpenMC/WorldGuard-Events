# WorldGuard Events

Version modifi√©e de [Webbeh/WorldGuard-Events](https://github.com/Webbeh/WorldGuard-Events) pour OpenMC

## For developers
### Events
This API provides you with the following events :

   - **RegionsChangedEvent**
   - **RegionsEnteredEvent**
   - **RegionsLeftEvent**
   - **RegionEnteredEvent**
   - **RegionLeftEvent**

All of those are fired upon each player movement into a new set of regions, in that order.

They are all pretty self-explainatory. You can use any event interchangeably : the events returning a single ProtectedRegion are fired at the same time as the events returning a Set of ProtectedRegions (which is useful if you have multiple overlapping/neighbouring regions).

Cancelling any of the events will prevent the movement from happening.

### API
On top of events, and since version 1.15.2 of this plugin, we now provide you with a small API to get the most basic informations out of WorldGuard :

   - **getRegions**
   - **getRegionNames**
   - **isPlayerInRegion**
   - **isPlayerInAnyRegion**
   - **isPlayerInAllRegions**

All of those use the UUID of the player to fetch information about him from WorldGuard.

***Be aware that those region names are case insensitive, just like WorldGuard, and that they are checked for the world the player is currently in.***
## Usage example

```java
import net.raidstone.wgevents.WorldGuardEvents;
import net.raidstone.wgevents.events.RegionEnteredEvent;
import net.raidstone.wgevents.events.RegionsLeftEvent;
import org.bukkit.Bukkit;
import org.bukkit.entity.Player;
import org.bukkit.event.EventHandler;
import org.bukkit.event.Listener;
import org.bukkit.plugin.java.JavaPlugin;
import java.util.Set;

public class TestPlugin extends JavaPlugin implements Listener {
    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        Bukkit.getPluginManager().registerEvents(this, this);
     
        // On plugin activation, send a message to players that are located in a jail.
        for(Player p : Bukkit.getOnlinePlayers())
        {
            if(WorldGuardEvents.isPlayerInAnyRegion(p.getUniqueId(), "jail", "cell"))
            {
                p.sendMessage("You are in jail ! Did you do something bad ?");
            }
        }
    }
 
   @EventHandler
   public void onRegionEntered(RegionEnteredEvent event)
   {
       Player player = Bukkit.getPlayer(event.getUUID());
       if (player == null) return;
     
       String regionName = event.getRegionName();
       if(regionName.equalsIgnoreCase("jail"))
       {
           player.sendMessage("You are now in jail !");
       }
   }

   @EventHandler
   public void onRegionsLeft(RegionsLeftEvent event)
   {
       Player player = Bukkit.getPlayer(event.getUUID());
       if(player == null) return;
     
       Set<String> regionsNames = event.getRegionsNames();
     
       if(regionsNames.contains("jail") || regionsNames.contains("cell"))
       {
           player.sendMessage("You are in jail, you can't escape !");
           event.setCancelled(true);
       }
   }
}
